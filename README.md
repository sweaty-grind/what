i can only help you with this cause apparently nobody wants to deal with anything.  i feel we are nearing a new event horizon...

so what can i tell you???  i'm drained fuck this shark and retard reality.  in a real situation i would go smash glass but we are in the oopsies i accidently did it side of everything.

oh well it is what it is...  why is my brain like this bro???  more easy peazy lemon earthquake squeezy.

lets not talk about it...  i feel you are gimped and i should not be so heavy handed but i think i'm doing a good job of it now.  what can i say?? i wondered a lot of things and nothing came around...

oh yeah earthquake...  i was talking about it during crusader phase.  i dont know i think this just happened...
